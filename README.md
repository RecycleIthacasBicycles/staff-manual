# staff-participant-manual
Best participant practices for staff, with suggested scripts for participant engagement.

Thanks to Josh Bisker of NYC Mechanical Gardens for compiling the
bulk of this list of participant conditions which community shops encounter in
daily functioning. Responses and scripts provided by cyclista.

----

>    Work with participants to diagnose and address mechanical issues,
>    instead of leaving participants to their own devices.

ask:
"What are you hoping to get done today?"

and:
"How much time are you hoping to spend?"

and:
"What is the main kind of riding you want to do?"

This helps staff cultivate overall situational awareness, as well as
setting the template for the task. Let the participant know what kind
of time (or money) requirements the work they need involves.

----

>    Check in on participants' levels of skill, and work with them
>    appropriately.

ask:
"Do you have any personal or professional mechanic experience?"

and (regardless of answer):
"How much help do you want?"

This sets the stage for respecting the competency and agency of the
individual while establishing the path for help.

----

>    Balance putting-the-tools-in-participants' hands with instructing
>    them about how to do repairs.

In open shop, for an inexperienced participant the first repair of a
specific component should be performed as a demonstration by the
facilitator, with detailed description and encouragement for questions.
This demonstration is helpful because remote-controlling an inexperienced
participant's hands with words is frustrating and cumbersome for both
facilitator and participant, and many people learn physical skills much
better by observing actions rather than memorizing words. Observing the
participant's attention is crucial to determine if they seem to be
understanding.

asking:
"Does this make sense?"

may be helpful. Assert that questions are welcome, and in fact
encouraged. This doesn't mean the first repair of the entire bike is
done by the facilitator; for instance, the facilitator may tighten one
brake caliper, while the participant tightens the second one, under
supervision. Sometimes, manually demonstrating a principle is enough,
and the participant can use that principle to undertake the task by
themselves; for instance pointing out the numbers on a tire pump gauge
and the recommended pressure lettering on the side of a tire sets the
stage for someone to inflate the tire by themselves. The end goal is
always the autonomy of the participant.

----

>    Balance granting participants the freedom to fail while also guiding
>    their work.

This often involves pretending not to be paying attention - though of course
facilitators should always be paying attention. In a busy environment, the
necessity for dividing time among multiple participants often provides easy
cover for this manufactured autonomy. Always be aware of a participant's
energy, stress, and interest/boredom levels, regardless of whether you are
directly interacting or pretending to be busy elsewhere - or actually being
busy elsewhere.

----

>    Check out participants' bikes for the ABCs of mechanical safety.

When a participant brings in their own bike, it cannot be the requirement
of the shop that the participant's bicycle not leave the premises unless
safe, for obvious reasons. However, bikes built on-site and bikes sold
on-site must be inspected by staff cleared for safety inspections before
leaving the premises. Facilitators will, at some remove, always be passively
auditing what parts of a participant's bicycle work is being done on and
tactfully intervening accordingly.

----

>    Check out participants' bikes for other things that can be wrong.

Provided the participant has not identified themselves as competent and
autonomous, inspection of the bike should be encouraged during introductions,
though left optional and phrased as a question.

ask:
"Would you like me to look over your bike to see if there are any other areas
needing attention?"

All work, whether the participant's expected work or expanded work, has to
be balanced out with the time the participant is willing to spend and any
safety hazards posed by delayed or defrayed work. This can be a tricky area
expectation-wise, as many people think something simple is their problem
when in fact there is a more complicated or dangerous issue. Again, let the
participant know as early as possible what kind of time (or money)
requirement the work they need involves.

----

>    Intervene if unsafe bikes are about to roll out the door -- like
>    ones with no brakes connected.

Bikes brought in by participants cannot be controlled by the shop. But it is
the job of facilitators to clearly inform participants of unsafe conditions
in their bicycles. Participants sometimes take exception to being told
whether something they own is hazardous or not, it might be likened to a
cigarette smoker's aversion to being lectured on the dangers of smoking or a
teenager's aversion to be lectured on their quality of judgement. Facilitators
are, however, empowered by shop policy with the prerogative to make themselves
heard where issues of serious safety lapses are concerned. Again, of course
for bikes brought in by a participant, the ultimate decision regarding what
to do about any safety issue rests with that participant.

----

>    Address issues of parts quality for recommending replacement versus
>    repair.

This kind of appraisal can happen liberally anywhere that safety is a
concern - plastic brake levers, for instance. Where safety is not in question,
this can happen as part of the ongoing conversation with a participant. In
many cases this can be a way to get the participant to be more invested in
and excited about their bike, as often they will come in unaware that
reconfigurability is a feature.

Facilitators must alway temper their view of a participant's bike with
the kinds of experiences the participant has stated they want from it. Don't
try to persuade a mountain bike rider to give up trails, trade out their
knobbies for slicks, and become urban cyclists, or try to persuade commuters
to take up cyclocross and convert their hybrids or road bikes into some more
trail-appropriate machine. Unless told otherwise, trust that the participant
has a vision for the kind of riding they want to do, and tailor enhancement
suggestions accordingly.

ask:
"Do you want some recommendations for upgrades?"

or:
"Do you want my recommendations for this bike?"

or:
"I think there are some options you might find interesting. Should I
suggest them?"

----

>    Embody anti-oppression ethics for engagement with participants.

A shared learning environment is about extension of power, which inherently
contradicts oppression. The principle should be maintained that as long as
safety is taken into consideration, each participant is worthy of and
entitled to the knowledge offered.

Deflect overbearing, condescending, or crude behavior, reframe the
interaction.

Abusive, bigoted, violent, or extremely disruptive behavior
can be confronted. Take the participant aside and say something like:

"This is not how we behave here. You can be respectful and civil, or you can
leave."

If the participant will not come aside, confronting them in front of other
participants is okay. Once they've left, sincerely apologize to everyone,
make sure everyone's project is on track, and leave people to process the
disruption in their own ways unless further discussion is requested.

----

>    Promote feminism in their engagement with participants.

Always maintain awareness that millennia of social norms which consistently
excluded women from autonomy, education, industry, and ownership of property
is conditioning that bears upon us all, whether born male or female, and that
this shapes our impressions of women's capabilities and aptitudes, even at a
subconscious level. Positive actions are required to reverse this paradigm,
and in a shop environment this means, in part, giving women the benefit of the
doubt where a question of competence is concerned, assuming nothing regarding
what they can or cannot do, do or do not have an affinity for, and do or do
not understand. In short, be aware of what experience you offer women, and
make certain that it truly is equivalent in quality to what men might be
offered in the same setting.

----

>    Sexuality and romance in the shop space.

In most teacher/student relationships there is a power balance which favors
the teacher.

Teachers must provide the expected information in order to play their part
in the expected exchange, but a student's part involves risk, as it entails
not only extending trust to a teacher, but to some extent submitting to
them. This inherent power imbalance creates not only an imperative, but
also urgency for responsible and safe conduct on the part of the teacher.

At the shop, the teacher role is one occupied by staff and volunteers involved
in instruction and assistance, and participants often, but not always, take
the role of student. This engagement is tacitly expected by participants to
focus exclusively on bicycles, mechanics, design, and cycling.

It can be difficult, if not impossible, in a closed building with a social
climate, an aesthetic character, and constrained time windows, to create,
distinguish, and maintain boundaries between what is purely social conduct
and what is part of the student/teacher relationship. This difficulty blurs
the lines and boundaries of power as well. Is the student receptive to the
teacher's flirtation during times the teacher deems purely social because
the student fully agrees and understands the boundary between professional
and social has been mutually crossed? Or has the student accidentally
carried over, into what might be social, a component of submission and trust
from the professional interactions?

These ambiguities make it essential (mandatory) for staff members to
maintain a standard of professional behavior defined more or less exclusively
by commitment to the work of guiding participants in mechanics, design,
aesthetics, history, learning itself, and the properties of a cooperative
environment that is based on empowerment and understanding.

Make no mistake that a staff member's individual distinctiveness remains
crucial; without character, warmth, empathy, and interpersonal connection
instruction can (and probably will) be dull and opaque - participants might
well read any relevant book or study a schematic were a teacher's language
and wit not required. But sexuality and romance are areas too often
susceptible to persuasion and uncertain boundaries even outside of a dynamic
of explicit power imbalance, and these zones must therefore be off limits
while on the clock at the shop.

These concerns supercede ideologies of sex-positivity (we are supporters of
sex positivity) because avoiding the potential for abuse and damage is
considered significantly more important.
